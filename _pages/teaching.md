One of my passions in academia involves teaching. So far, I was lucky enough to gain experience both in teaching Bachelor and Master level students as well as supervising theses on these levels. 

# Teaching during my own studies
During my own studies I got insights into teaching EDV skills for first semester students of [Physical Activity and Health, B.Sc.](https://www.uni-giessen.de/en/study/courses/ba/pah/index?set_language=en) at Justus Liebig University Giessen. Here I introduced students to literature research as well as citation programs.

# Teaching during during my PhD
Now that I am in my PhD, I am also involved in a variety of different courses in the [Cognitive Science, B.Sc.](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/studieren/studieninteressierte/studienangebot_studiengaenge/studiengang_196608.en.jsp) as well as [Cognitive Science, M.Sc.](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/studieren/studieninteressierte/studienangebot_studiengaenge/studiengang_196672.en.jsp). 

These courses include:
- Grundlagen der Cognitive Science – (Introduction to Python)
- Psychologisches Experimentalpraktikum
- Cognitive Science III: Handeln
- Topics in Cognitive Science - (Topics in Multisensory Perception and Action)
- Cognitive Science Master Project I

An up-to-date list can be found on my [personal webpage from the university}(https://www.psychologie.tu-darmstadt.de/sensorimotor/home_sensorimotor/people_sensorimotor/people_details_75712.en.jsp).

# Thesis supervision
I also supervise both Bachelor and Master students in Cognitive Science for their thesis projects. So far I was involved in the supervion about the following topics:

## 2023
- Linking suggestibility to the perception of arm movement: Felt motor distortion through the manipulation of visual feedback (B.Sc. Cognitive Science) – supervised by Celine Honekamp & Loes C.J. van Dam

## 2025
- Repeated Exposures to Delays in Virtual Reality: Reward-Independent Tendencies Toward Visuomotor Recalibration (M.Sc. Psychology) – supervised by Celine Honekamp & Loes C.J. van Dam
- Enhancing goal-directed reaching: comparing static and dynamic vibrotactile feedback (B.Sc. Cognitive Science) – supervised by Celine Honekamp & Loes C.J. van Dam
- Vibrotactile feedback as counter measure for visually induced postural sway (B.Sc. Cognitive Science) – supervised by Celine Honekamp, Kai Streiling & Loes C.J. van Dam
- The interaction between temporal and spatial dimensions in visuomotor adaptation (M.Sc. Cognitive Science) – supervised by Celine Honekamp & Loes C.J. van Dam
- Dual adaptation to temporal delays in 2D motor control: Insights from interception and continuous tracking (B.Sc. Cognitive Science) – supervised by Celine Honekamp & Loes C.J. van Dam
- Learning Vibrotactile Biofeedback in an EMG Cursor Control Task: A Comparison of Visual and Vibrotactile Feedback Modalities (B.Sc. Cognitive Science) – supervised by Celine Honekamp & Loes C.J. van Dam
