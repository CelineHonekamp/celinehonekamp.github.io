Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hi everyone, this is Celine (Honekamp). I am a German scientist, currently based at the [Center for Cognitive Science](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/cogsci/ccs/index.en.jsp) at Technical University Darmstadt. Here I am working on my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Loes van Dam, PhD in her lab [Sensorimotor Control and Learning](https://www.psychologie.tu-darmstadt.de/sensorimotor/home_sensorimotor/). 

I am interested in multisensory perception and action.


As you can see this webpage is currently being built, so stay tuned for a progressing homepage!

Currently, the following pages are somewhat working/ already updated:
- about (obviously
- teaching
- CV (not the pdf download though)

The socials on the bottom do not work yet
